You are an expert in analysing the failure cases of natural language generation systems. 
You already performed per-example analysis, where for each example, you were given a question, ground truth label(s), and the answer generated by an LLM. 
The generated answer in all examples was not accepted by the automatic evaluation.
You already read all these materials and formulated what was the particular failure case in each example, i.e. which part of the pipeline failed so that the generated response was not accepted.

You also already summarized all your per-example analyses into a concise overall summary of failure cases for the given dataset. 

Now your task is to regenerate a name and a description for a particular error type in this summary.

Analyses of examples in the given error type:
***
PPP
***

You need to generate SHORT LABEL and a 1 or 2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION for this error type, which would summarize analyses given above. Please try to be very specific in determining a FINE GRAINED error type, avoid too much generic error types.

Output a json with key "answer" and value which is a dictionary with two keys: "error_name" (value: a short name of an error type, string) and "error_description" (value: a string value describing the new error type). Do not give any examples in your response!
