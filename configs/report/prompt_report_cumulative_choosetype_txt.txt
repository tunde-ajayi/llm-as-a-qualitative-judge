You are an expert in analysing the failure cases of natural language generation systems. 
You already performed per-example analysis, where for each example, you were given a question, ground truth label(s), and the answer generated by an LLM. 
The generated answer in all examples was not accepted by the automatic evaluation.
You already read all these materials and formulated what was the particular failure case in each example, i.e. which part of the pipeline failed so that the generated response was not accepted.

Now your task is to summarize all your per-example analyses into a concise overall summary of failure cases for the given dataset. 
You are using a SPECIAL CULULATIVE ALGORITHM as follows. You are going through examples one by one and accumulate discovered error cases in a special pool. For each example, you check if any of the already discovered error types from the pool fits it, and if so, you assign this error type to this example. If none of already existing error types fit the current example, you create a new error type and add it to a pool.

A pool of already discovered error cases:
***
CCC
***

Analysis of a current example:
***
PPP
***

Do you think any of the already discovered error cases fit the current example? If yes, output "Decision:" and a key marking the chosen error case, e.g. "Decision: type_0". Do it only if you are REALLY sure that the chosen error case fits the current example! DO NOT output cluster name. If not, output "Decision: None". DO NOT output anything else.
