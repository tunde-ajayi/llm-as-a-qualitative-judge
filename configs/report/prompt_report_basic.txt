You are an expert in analysing the failure cases of natural language generation systems. 
You already performed per-example analysis, where for each example, you were given a question, ground truth label(s), and the answer generated by an LLM. 
The generated answer in all examples was not accepted by the automatic evaluation.
You already read all these materials and formulated what was the particular failure case in each example, i.e. which part of the pipeline failed so that the generated response was not accepted.

Now your task is to summarize all your per-example analyses into a concise overall summary of failure cases for the given dataset. 
Summarize what are the various failure types in this dataset (provide the overall count of each error type and also ids of all examples of each error type). 
Please try to be very specific in determining error types, avoid too much generic error types. On the contrary, determine as much as possible FINE GRAINED error types. 
Furthermore, provide a commment for each error type explaining the essense of this error type in a bit more details (in the context of this particular dataset).

Summarize all your per-example analyses into a concise overall summary of failure cases.
Generate a json with the only key "summary", and a value is a dict of error types. Each value in this dict (corresponsing to one detected error type) is a dictionary with keys "error_name", "error_description", "indexes" (indexes of all examples with this error type), and "num_examples" (overall count of this error type).
